# `.gitignore` C

- The [Ignoring Files chapter][chapter] of the [Pro Git][progit] book.

## Folder structure

We support a collection of templates, organized in this way:

- The root folder contains templates in common use, to help people get started

## What makes a good template?

Please also understand that we can’t list every tool that ever existed.

## Contributing guidelines

- **Provide a link to the application or project’s homepage**. Unless it’s
  extremely popular, there’s a chance the maintainers don’t know about or use
  the language, framework, editor, app, or project your change applies to.

In general, the more you can do to help us understand the change you’re making,
the more likely we’ll be to accept your contribution quickly.

## Versioned templates

Some templates can change greatly between versions, and if you wish to contribute
to this repository we need to follow this specific flow:

- the template at the root should be the current supported version
- the template at the root should not have a version in the filename (i.e.
  "evergreen")
- previous versions of templates should live under `community/`
- previous versions of the template should embed the version in the filename,
  for readability

This helps ensure users get the latest version (because they'll use whatever is
at the root) but helps maintainers support older versions still in the wild.

3. Make your changes to your fork.
